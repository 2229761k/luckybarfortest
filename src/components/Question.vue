          <h4>What is Etherball?</h4>
          <p class="lead">Etherball is a lottery built on top of the Etherum blockchain. Because of its decentralized
            nature, Etherball is completely controlled by the blockchain, so payments and ticket-buying is secured with
            the power of millions of computers around the world.</p>
          <h4>Why should I trust it?</h4>
          <p class="lead">You're free (and encouraged) to check out the source code at (etherscan link here). If you
            have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me using the links at the bottom of the page.</p>
          <h4>How can I use Etherball?</h4>
          <p class="lead">The easiest way to use Etherball is to download the Metamask wallet <a href="https://metamask.io">here</a>,
            send your Metamask wallet some ether using an exchange of sorts, and choosing a ticket to buy at the top of
            the page.</p>
          <h4>My transaction isn't going through. Why?</h4>
          <p class="lead">Try raising your gas limit for the transaction. Don't worry if it seems high; most of the
            times, the gas limit isn't even reached. Also, it's possible that someone else just bought the ticket that
            you clicked on and the website or blockchain didn't update yet. Try choosing a different ticket.</p>
          <h4>Why so few tickets?</h4>
          <p class="lead">Fewer tickets equals to faster games, which means less time waiting to see if you've won! The
            game resets automatically too, so you can play more games quicker.</p>
          <h4>What's your share?</h4>
          <p class="lead">Nothing! All of the ether raised by tickets goes to the winner. </p>
